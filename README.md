# git-github-assignment
A lab assignment for ISE 211 using Git.

I learned how to create my own repository, clone a repository, create a .txt file within my repository, and add, commit, and push accordingly.
I also learned how to branch and merge when needed, as well as how to fork, branch and edit on someone else's repo, as well as create a pull request.
I learned, as well, how to accept/deny a pull request and when/why to do so.
